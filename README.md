# Config
unix config, somewhat my own and somewhat stolen from sensei hotz

### Installing:

```bash
./install.sh
```

There is also an `update.sh` script to grab the most recent files from the git repository

### TODO:

- [ ] Make scripts cancel on ctrl+c
- [x] Make scrpits grab from local repo by default
- [ ] Make scripts quit if git repo does not exist (or grab from remote repo if possible)
- [x] Enable ssh if prompted
- [x] Modular support for different package managers
- [x] Automatic detection of OS to determine package manager
